- - - - - - - - - - MuSCW:

- - - - - Must have:
- Combine the buttons.
- Add a few inputs I THINK is needed so I can show it off to mom and Twig
- A placeholder for now, but it need the GDPR "what will we use this info for". IE, the danish terrorist register and our anonymized statistics

- - - - - Should have:
- Fix the functionality so it ADDS to the CSV file, instead of making new ones

- - - - - Could have

- The names of the columns as the first row (Maybe not, since its only function might be to make it more of a bother to combine the data)



- - - - - Wont have
